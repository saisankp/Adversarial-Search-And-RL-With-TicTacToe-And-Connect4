Commands to run the project (Using Python 3.9):

NOTE: Do not run using a PyCharm IDE unless you choose the "terminal tab". Preferably, run this in a regular terminal.

1. source venv/bin/activate
2. python main.py
3. Use the up/down arrow keys to select options and input values into the interface!

There are pretrained agents in pickle files in this directory for both Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4. Enjoy :)


Thanks!
